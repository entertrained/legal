## Cookies Policy

_Last Updated: October 31, 2024_

Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information. This policy specifically explains how we and our partners deploy cookies and other similar items, as well as the options you have to control them.

### Creative Commons Sharealike License

We've decided to make this Cookies Policy available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. You're more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, we'd appreciate a credit and link to Entertrained somewhere on your site.

The text of the policy is based on the work of folks at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), shared under the same license. You can grab a copy of the original text from their [Github repository](https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic/blob/master/Cookie-Policy.md).

### Definitions

#### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device by websites you visit. They help websites remember information about your visit, making your online experience smoother and more personalized. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as "first party cookies"), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website ("third party cookies").

Types of Cookies:

- Session Cookies: These are temporary cookies that are deleted when you close your browser. They help websites remember your actions during a single browsing session, like keeping you logged in while you navigate through different pages.

- Persistent Cookies: These cookies remain on your device until they expire or you delete them. They help websites remember your preferences and settings for future visits, making your experience more convenient.

#### Local Storage

LocalStorage is a feature in your web browser that allows websites to store data on your device. Unlike cookies, which are also used for storing data, localStorage is designed to hold more information and keep it even after you close your browser.

#### IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a feature in your web browser that allows websites to store large amounts of structured data on your device. Unlike cookies and localStorage, IndexedDB is designed to handle more complex data and larger volumes of information.

#### Other

Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as "web beacons" or "pixels." These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

### **How we use cookies and other storage**

We use cookies and other web storage technologies for a number of different purposes. Some are necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users; and some allow the display of advertising from selected third-party networks. Some of these technologies may be activated when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking a button, for example).

Types of Storage Technologies We Use:

- Cookies: Used for advertising and analytics purposes.
- IndexedDB: Used to store user progress and statistics, as well as cache book data for fast access and a better experience.
- Local Storage: Used to hold session information.

For more information on the choices you have about the technologies we use, please see the Controlling Cookies and Storage section below.

### **Types of Storage**

The following paragraphs explain the types of storage we use on our websites and why we use it.

#### Required storage

This storage is essential for our websites and services to perform basic functions and is necessary for us to operate certain features. This includes storage required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account-related functions, store preferences set by users such as account name, language, progress and statistics, and ensure our services are operating properly. We use localStorage and IndexedDB for this purpose.

To enhance your experience, we also use IndexedDB to cache certain content. This helps us deliver a faster and more efficient website by reducing the need to fetch data from our servers repeatedly. The cached data is non-personal and is used solely to improve website performance. You can manage and clear this cached data through your browser settings or our website's [Settings](https://entertrained.app/settings/#manage-data) page.

#### Analytics and performance

This storage allows us to optimize performance by collecting information on how users interact with our websites, including which pages are visited most, as well as other analytical data. We use these details to improve how our websites function and to understand how users interact with them. We may use some of the cookies for this purpose.

#### Advertising

This storage is set by us and our advertising partners to provide you with relevant content and to understand that content’s effectiveness. It may be used to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites to predict your preferences and to display more relevant advertisements to you. This also allows a profile to be built about you and your interests and enables personalized ads to be shown to you based on your profile. We may use some of the cookies for this purpose.

### Examples

Below are examples of the storage entries set by Entertrained, with explanations of their purpose. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, but rather aims to be representative. Information about cookies that may be set by third parties, such as our ads partners, is below.

#### **Required**

- `anonymous` (IndexedDB database) - used to store preferences, statistics and progress for anonymous users,
- `{user_id}` (IndexedDB database) - used to store preferences, statistics and progress for logged in user,
- `cache` (IndexedDB database) - used to temporarily store content like books' info and chapters' content for quick access,
- `sb-qamwpfhpiibjioqqyges-auth-token` (localStorage entry) - used to store access token and user session information.

#### **Analytics and Performance**

We currently do not use this.

#### **Advertising**

We currently do not use this.

#### **Advertisements from Third Parties Through Entertrained’s Ads Program**

We currently do not use this.

### Controlling Cookies

Visitors may wish to manage or restrict the use of various web storage options, including cookies, localStorage, and IndexedDB. Most browsers offer built-in functionalities or third-party plugins to control these storage mechanisms, such as setting expiration times or completely disabling them. Please be aware that disabling these storage options may affect the functionality of some features on our service. To find out more on how to manage and delete cookies, visit [aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/). For more details on your choices regarding use of your web browsing activity for interest-based advertising visit [youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu) (EU based) or [optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info) (US based).

Some analytics services we use, which place their own cookies or web tags on your browser, offer their own opt out choices. For example, you can opt out of Google Analytics by installing [Google’s opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout), from Hotjar by using the [Do Not Track header](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out), and from Nielsen by clicking the opt out link found within [Nielsen's Privacy Statement](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/).

<!-- ### Our Internal Analytics Tool -->
<!---->
<!-- In order to better understand how our services are used, we monitor certain user activities that take place within our products, including page views and clicks on any links used when managing a site via our dashboards. We call each one of these actions an “event.” Analytics events are attached to your WordPress.com account and are handled via a first party system that Entertrained owns and maintains. In general, we record the following data for each event: IP address, WordPress.com user ID and username, WordPress.com-connected site ID (for sites not hosted on WordPress.com), user agent, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, and country code. We use this information to improve our products, make our marketing to you more relevant, personalize your experience, and for the other purposes described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/). You may opt out of our analytics program through your user settings. By doing so, you won’t share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Note that opting out does not disable the functionality of the actions we track - for example, if you publish a post, we will still have record of that (don’t worry!), but for an event or action after you opt out, we will not have other data associated with that action or event in the analytics tool. -->

### Consent for Non-essential Cookies on Our Sites

You may see a “cookie banner” on our website. If you are visiting our website from the EU, then we do not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you click to accept. When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set advertising cookies on the site you are visiting, which we can use to show you advertisements about various products.

The same is true for performance and analytics cookies for EU users. These cookies will only be set after you provide your consent. They are used by us and our partners to monitor and analyze website performance and user behavior.

We’ll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.

You can revise your choices at any moment in [Settings](https://entertrained.app/settings/#manage-data).
